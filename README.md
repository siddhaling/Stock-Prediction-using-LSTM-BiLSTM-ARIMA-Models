# StockPredictionModelComparison
The project compares three models for Stock Price Prediction being **(LSTM, BI-LSTM and ARIMA)** and plots the predicted stock as well as analyses the RMSE to find the best model.

The Project was done by **Justin Sunil David** **(2018A7PS0259U-BITS PILANI, DUBAI)** and **Irine Sara Benoy (2018A7PS0280U-BITS PILANI, DUBAI)**

This project is a classification of three models of prediction using their Root Mean Squared Error to analyse the best of the three. The dataset was taken from Yahoo Finance's Google Stock History -
