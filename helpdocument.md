> ****Help Document****

The following code is written completely in python with the help of a few additional python libraries.  //The File for the same is located [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ixsi7TJbtyuDwI1vcI-1KeMtXNCqiyWiavZEPWoxU2s/edit?usp=sharing).

Here are all the dependencies and libraries that we have used to create our prediction model.

**pandas** : Used for database computation and cleaning up given databases. 

**numpy** : NumPy can be used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays. It adds powerful data structures to Python that guarantee efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.

**sklearn** : Python library used to import MinMax Scaler.

**keras** : Keras is used for creating deep models which can be productized on smartphones. Keras is also used for distributed training of deep learning models.

**matplotlib** : Matplotlib is a cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting library for Python and its numerical extension NumPy.

Being completely dependent on python, google-colaboratory was used to run the code and analyse the models. The entire code can be found on the StockPredictor.ipynb file.
